                    <p class="col-md-11 fs-4">PodScholar is a platform for scholars to podcast their published work.
                        Each
                        podcast provides the scholar an
                        opportunity to discuss their manuscript with an informative and conversational tone. Each
                        podcast is created by a
                        scholar or research group and each podcast corresponds to one of the scholar’s published
                        articles. Scholars are
                        encouraged to discuss all main parts of the published work including, but not limited to the
                        introduction,
                        methods, results and discussion sections. Scholars now have a platform to broadcast their work
                        as a dialogue in
                        which they have autonomy as to how they want to explain and discuss their own scholarship. The
                        rules for
                        podcasting are straight forward, but the most basic rule is one podcast per one published
                        article!
                    </p>
                    <p class="col-md-11 fs-4">
                        Currently, PodScholar podcasts are limited to a 20-minute maximum duration. Podcasts include the
                        journal link to
                        help listeners find the published article for further reading and dissemination. The PodScholar
                        audio library will
                        increase as more scholars upload their content. Any published scholarship can be podcasted and
                        uploaded,
                        regardless of date published and discipline. PodScholar aims to create the world’s largest audio
                        library of scholarly
                        activity which is created and narrated by the professionals who conducted the research. Join the
                        PodScholar
